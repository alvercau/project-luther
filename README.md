# Project Luther

## Scenario

A rich and powerful man decides that he wants to produce a Sci-Fi or Fantasy movie. He does not really care about money because he has so much of it that it became absolutely irrelevant. His main goal is to be popular and loved, so he wants to know what he can do to make the movie well received, both by critics and by the audience.

## Question:

* Which variables have an influence on how a Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie is received, both by critics and by the audience?

## Description of my sample of movies and/or other data:

* 1484 movies from the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/dvd-streaming-all?minTomato=0&maxTomato=100&services=amazon;hbo_go;itunes;netflix_iw;vudu;amazon_prime;fandango_now&genres=14&sortBy=release) website, from the category 'Sci-Fi and Fantasy'. 
* No selection by date or rating, all movies from the category are taken into account.

__Note:__ Code is written to easily scrape data from other categories.


## Characteristics of each movie:

* Sci-Fi or Fantasy
* Following variables are collected:
> 1. Critics score
> 2. Critics rating
> 3. Number of critics reviews
> 4. Number of 'Fresh' classifications
> 5. Number of 'Rotten' classifications
> 6. Audience score
> 7. Audience rating
> 8. Number of audience reviews
> 9. Director
> 10. Box office
> 11. Runtime
> 12. Release date in theaters
> 13. Release date on disc
> 14. Rating
> 15. Studio  

Given that money is a non-issue, box office can be dropped.
